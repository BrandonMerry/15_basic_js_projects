This project applies a scroll function to the nav bar 
as you scroll, it is applied when you reach a pixel height. 
The function also introduces smooth scroll to transition between the 
elements of the nav bar and the correlating sections on a single page layout. 

This is a dynamic setup that formats for small screen nav toggles 
and a large screen layout.
